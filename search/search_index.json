The intention of the Donkey Store is to make it easier and less expensive to build the Donkey Car.  The Donkey Store is run by the original founders of donkey car and profits are used to fund development of the donkey cars.  Also it is worth noting the design of the parts out of the Donkey store is slightly improved over the standard build as it uses better parts that are only available in large quantities or are harder to get.  The Donkey Store builds are open source like all others.   \n\n\nIf you are in Asia, the DIYRobocars community in Hong Kong also sells car kits at \nRobocar Store\n.  They are long term Donkey community members and use proceeds to support the R&D efforts of this project. It is worth noting they can also sell to Europe and the US but it is likely less cost effective.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Description\n\n\nLink\n\n\nApproximate Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceed Magnet, Desert Monster, Blaze, or Short Course Truck\n\n\nSee links above\n\n\n~$90\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB Battery with microUSB cable (any battery capable of 2A 5V output is sufficient)\n\n\nAnker 6700 mAh\n\n\n$17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi 3\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B01CD5VC92\n\n\n$38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroSD Card (many will work, I like this one because it boots quickly)\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B01HU3Q6F2\n\n\n$18.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonkey Partial Kit\n\n\nMagnet\n or \nDesert Monster, SCT, Blaze\n\n\n$85 or $92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2:Bottoms Up Build\n\n\nIf you want to buy the parts yourself, want to customize your donkey or live out to of the US, you may want to choose the bottoms up build.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Description\n\n\nLink\n\n\nApproximate Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnet Car or alternative\n\n\nBlue\n, \nRed\n\n\n$92\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM2x6 screws (4)\n\n\nmcmaster.com/#91292a831/=177k4rp\n\n\n$6.38 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM2.5x12 screws (8)\n\n\nmcmaster.com/#91292a016/=177k574\n\n\n$4.80 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM2.5 nuts (8)\n\n\nmcmaster.com/#91828a113/=177k7ex\n\n\n$5.64 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM2.5 washers (8)\n\n\nmcmaster.com/#93475a196/=177k7x6\n\n\n$1.58 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB Battery with microUSB cable (any battery capable of 2A 5V output is sufficient)\n\n\nAnker 6700 mAh\n\n\n$17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi 3\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B01CD5VC92\n\n\n$38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroSD Card (many will work, I like this one because it boots quickly)\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B01HU3Q6F2\n\n\n$18.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWide Angle Raspberry Pi Camera\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B00N1YJKFS\n\n\n$25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale to Female Jumper Wire\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B010L30SE8\n\n\n$7 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServo Driver PCA 9685\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B014KTSMLA\n\n\n$12 **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Printed roll cage and top plate.\n\n\nPurchase: \nDonkey Store\n Files: \nthingiverse.com/thing:2260575\n\n\n$45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* These components come in minimum quantities much higher than is necessary for a vehicle.

I printed parts in black PLA, with 2mm layer height and no supports.  The top roll bar is designed to be printed upside down.   Remember that you need to print the adapters unless you have a \"Magnet\"\n\n\nI printed parts in black PLA, with .3mm layer height with a .5mm nozzle and no supports.  The top roll bar is designed to be printed upside down.  \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 2: Clean up parts\n\n\nAlmost all 3D Printed parts will need clean up.  Re-drill holes, and clean up excess plastic.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, clean up the slots in the side of the roll bar, as shown in the picture below:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 3: Assemble Top plate and Roll Cage\n\n\nIf you have an Exceed Short Course Truck, Blaze or Desert Monster watch this \nvideo\n\n\nSlide the nut into the slot in the side of the roll cage.  This is not particularly easy.  You may need to clean out the hole again and use a small screwdriver to push the screw in such that it lines up with the hole in the bottom of the roll cage.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have slid the nut in, you can attach the bottom plate.  Once again, this may be tricky.  I use the small screwdriver to push against the nut to keep it from spinning in the slot.  Good news: you should never have to do this again.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 4: Connect Servo Shield to Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nYou could do this after attaching the Raspberry Pi to the bottom plate, I just think it is easier to see the parts when they are laying on the workbench.  Connect the parts as you see below:\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, below is the Raspberry Pi Pinout for reference.  You will notice we connect to 3.3v, the two I2C pins (SDA and SCL) and ground:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 5: Attach Raspberry Pi to 3D Printed bottom plate.\n\n\nBefore you start, now is a good time to insert the already flashed SD card and bench test the electronics.  Once that is done, attaching the Raspberry Pi and Servo is as simple as running screws through the board into the screw bosses on the top plate.  The M2.5x12mm screws should be the perfect length to go through the board, the plastic and still have room for a washer.  The \u201ccap\u201d part of the screw should be facing up and the nut should be on the bottom of the top plate.  The ethernet and USB ports should face forward.  This is important as it gives you access to the SD card and makes the camera ribbon cable line up properly.\n\n\nAttach the USB battery to the underside of the printed bottom plate using cable ties or velcro.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 6: Attach Camera\n\n\nThere are two versions of the donkey chassis, the newer one does not have screws, the older one does. This includes instructions for both:\n\n\nScrewless Design\n\nThe newer design is pretty simple, just slip the camera into the slot, cable end first.  However, be careful not to push on the camera lens and instead press the board.\n![donkey](../assets/build_hardware/assemble camera.jpg)\n\n\nIf you need to remove the camera the temptation is to push on the lens, instead push on the connector as is shown in these pictures.\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign with Screws\n\n\nAttaching the camera is a little tricky, the M2 screws can be screwed into the plastic but it is a little hard.  I recommend drilling the holes out with a 1.5mm bit (1/16th bit in Imperial land) then pre threading them with the screws before putting the camera on. It is only necessary to put two screws in.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes using the two top screw holes can result in a short. Put screws in the bottom two holes.\n\n\n\n\nBefore using the car, remove the plastic film from the camera lens.\n\n\n\n\nIt is easy to put the camera cable in the wrong way so look at these photos and make sure the cable is put in properly.  There are loads of tutorials on youtube if you are not used to this.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 7: Put it all together\n\n\n Note if you have a Desert Monster Chassis see 7B section below \n\nThe final steps are straightforward.  First attach the roll bar assembly to the car.  This is done using the same pins that came with the vehicle.  \n\n\n\n\nSecond run the servo cables up to the car.  The throttle cable runs to channel 0 on the servo controller and steering is channel 1.\n\n\n\n\nNow you are done with the hardware!!\n\n\nStep 7b: Attach Adapters (Desert Monster only)\n\n\nThe Desert monster does not have the same set up for holding the body on the car and needs two adapters mentioned above.  To attach the adapters you must first remove the existing adapter from the chassis and screw on the custom adapter with the same screws as is shown in this photo:\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, go back to step 7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nCongrats!

The \u201ccap\u201d part of the screw should be facing up and the nut should be on the bottom of the top plate.  The ethernet and USB ports should face forward.

Design with Screws  Attaching the camera is a little tricky, the M2 screws can be screwed into the plastic but it is a little hard.  I recommend drilling the holes out with a 1.5mm bit (1/16th bit in Imperial land) then pre threading them with the screws before putting the camera on. It is only necessary to put two screws in.   Sometimes using the two top screw holes can result in a short. Put screws in the bottom two holes.   Before using the car, remove the plastic film from the camera lens.

The fastest way is to use the disk image created for donkey cars.\n\n\nThe method for using a disk image to create a bootable SD card varies between\noperating systems. These instructions are for Ubuntu but you can see more\ninstructions \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nDownload prebuilt zipped disk image for \nRPi 3B and 3B+\n for \nRPi Zero\n (1.1GB).\n\n\nUnzip the disk image.\n\n\nPlug your SD card into your computer.\n\n\nOpen the \"Startup Disk Creator\" application.\n\n\nSelect your source disk image as the one you unzipped earlier.\n\n\nSelect your SD card as the disk to use.\n\n\nClick \"Make startup disk\".\n\n\n\n\nSetup the Pi's WiFi for first boot\n\n\nWe can create a special file which will be used to login to wifi on first boot. More reading \nhere\n, but we will walk you through it.\n\n\nOn Windows, with your memory card image burned and memory disc still inserted, you should see two drives, which are actually two partitions on the mem disc. One is labeled \nboot\n. On Mac and Linux, you should also have access to the \nboot\n partition of the mem disc. This is formated with the common FAT type and is where we will edit some files to help it find and log-on to your wifi on it's first boot.\n\n\n\n\nStart a text editor: \ngedit\n on Linux. Notepad on Windows. TextEdit on a Mac.\n\n\nPaste and edit this contents to match your wifi:\n\n\n\n\ncountry=US\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\n\nnetwork={\n    ssid=\"<your network name>\"\n    psk=\"<your password>\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \n<your network name>\n with the ID of your network.

On first boot, this file will be moved to \n/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n where it may be edited later.\n\n\n\n\nSetup Pi's Hostname\n\n\nWe can also setup the hostname so that your Pi easier to find once on the network. If yours is the only Pi on the network, then you can find it with\n\n\nping donkeypi.local\n\n\n\n\nonce it's booted. If there are many other Pi's on the network, then this will have problems. If you are on a Linux machine, or are able to edit the UUID partition, then you can edit the \n/etc/hostname\n and \n/etc/hosts\n files now to make finding your pi on the network easier after boot. Edit those to replace \nraspberrypi\n with a name of your choosing. Use all lower case, no special characters, no hyphens, no underscores \n_\n.\n\n\nsudo vi /media/userID/UUID/etc/hostname\nsudo vi /media/userID/UUID/etc/hosts\n\n\n\n\nNow you're SD card is ready. Eject it from your computer, put it in the Pi\nand plug in the Pi.\n\n\nConnecting to the Pi\n\n\nIf you followed the above instructions to add wifi access your Pi should\nnow be connected to your wifi network. Now you need to find its IP address\nso you can connect to it via SSH.\n\n\nThe easiest way (on Ubuntu) is to use the \nfindcar\n donkey command. You can try \nping donkeypi.local\n. If you've modified the hostname, then you should try: \nping <your hostname>.local\n. This will fail on a windows machine. Windows users will need the full IP address (unless using cygwin).\n\n\nIf you are having troubles locating your Pi on the network, you will want to plug in an HDMI monitor and USB keyboard into the Pi. Boot it. Login with:\n\n\n\n\nUsername: \npi\n\n\nPassword: \nraspberry\n\n\n\n\nThen try the command:\n\n\nifconfig wlan0\n\n\n\n\nIf this has a valid IPv4 address, 4 groups of numbers separated by dots, then you can try that with your SSH command. If you don't see anything like that, then your wifi config might have a mistake. You can try to fix with\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have a HDMI monitor and keyboard, you can plug-in the Pi with a CAT5 cable to a router with DHCP. If that router is on the same network as your PC, you can try:\n\n\nping donkeypi.local\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, one of those methods worked and you are now ready to SSH into your Pi. On Mac and Linux, you can open Terminal. On Windows you can install \nPutty\n or \none of the alternatives\n.\n\n\nIf you have a command prompt, you can try:\n\n\nssh pi@donkeypi.local\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nssh pi@<your pi ip address>\n\n\n\n\nor via Putty:\n\n Username: \npi\n\n\n Password: \nraspberry\n\n* Hostname:\n<your pi IP address>\n\n\nIf you are using the prebuilt image specified above, then your Pi is ready to go. You should see a mycar and donkey directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Check config.py to make sure it uses the correct settings for the PWM channel for steering and throttle. Open config.py \nnano ~/mycar/config.py\n and make sure that you see the lines:\n\n\n\n\nSTEERING_CHANNEL = 1\n\n\nTHROTTLE_CHANNEL = 0\n\n\n\n\nThe 1 and 0 for the parts arguments should match whichever channel you used to plug your servo/ESC leads in to your 9685 board. Usually this ranges from 0-15 and it numbered on the board.\n\n\nNote: If you are using the prebuilt image specified above, your Pi is not using the full capacity of the SD card. To make the full capacity accessible, SSH into the Pi and run \nsudo raspi-config\n to go into the configuration tool. Select \n7 Advanced Options\n and \nA1 Expand Filesystem\n. And then select \n<Finish>\n to exit the configuration tool and reboot. The Pi can access the full capacity of the SD card now.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Donkeycar\n\n\nThe disk image only has the libraries(tensorflow..) installed, not donkeycar.\n\n\npip install donkeycar[pi]\n#test that you are using the most recent version (found in __init__ file)\npython -c \"import donkeycar as dk; print(dk.__version__)\"\n\n\n\n\nCreate your car app.\n\n\nNow generate the drive script, config and folder structure for your car.\n\n\ndonkey createcar ~/mycar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's setup the same donkey library on your laptop or server so you can test and train autopilots.

The convention is then to distribute the training on a separate cluster of \ntraining instances\n. This, however, requires you to adapt your training script (and model) to work in a distributed manner, preferably using the \nSageMaker Python SDK\n, which is not currently available in Donkey.\n\n\nThat said, it is still possible to install and train your model on the \nNotebook instance\n. It will allow you to train your \nKeras model\n using a beefy instance type with a large GPU, and, perhaps most importantly, shut it down when finished so that you only pay for what you use.\n\n\nCreate a Notebook instance\n\n\nIf you havn't already, log in to your \nAWS Console\n and create a new \nAWS SageMaker\n Notebook instance:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-notebooks-instances.html#howitworks-create-ws\n\n\n\n\nSuggest using a \nml.p2.xlarge\n instance type. You can find a list of available types here:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/instance-types/\n\n\n\n\nClone the donkey git in SageMaker\n\n\nWhen you've created your new instance, open it up and create a new \nJupyter Notebook\n (click \nNew\n, \nconda_tensorflow_p36\n).\n\n\n\n\nIn the first cell, type:\n\n\n\n\n!git clone https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar ~/SageMaker/donkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the Jupyter Notebook (not the instance!). You can delete it if you want.\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkey on SageMaker\n\n\nAfter cloning the git, you'll find the donkey folder in the SageMaker Notebook root:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen \ndonkey/docs/guide/sm-install-donkey.ipynb\n and follow the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall another fork of donkeycar\n\n\nOccasionally you may want to run with changes from a separate fork of donkey. You may uninstall one and install another. That's fastest, but leaves you with only the forked version installed:\n\n\npip uninstall donkeycar\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/<username>/donkey donkey_<username>\ncd donkey_<username>\npip install -e .\n\n\n\n\nTo get back to the stock donkey install:\n\n\npip uninstall donkeycar\npip install donkeycar\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkeycar with TensorFlow dependencies\n\n\nDonkey requires the TensorFlow library to work. It comes in 2 flavors; \ntensorflow\n (CPU) and \ntensorflow-gpu\n (GPU).\n\n\nThis poses a problem, because if donkey specifies either of them as a dependency, \npip\n will uninstall any pre-installed version of the \nother\n flavor of the library. And since they are mutually exclusive, both cannot be listed as dependencies.\n\n\nTo solve this, donkey does not specify \ntensorflow\n nor \ntensorflow-gpu\n as dependencies. Instead, they are listed as \nextras_require\n, which means you have to explicitly tell \npip\n what flavor you want to use. If no flavor is specified (default), it is assumed one version of \nTensorFlow\n is already installed.\n\n\nInstall donkeycar assuming a compatible tensorflow library (either \ntensorflow\n or \ntensorflow-gpu\n) already installed:\n\n\n# Assuming CWD is the cloned donkey git\npip install donkeycar\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkeycar and use \ntensorflow\n dependency:\n\n\npip install donkeycar[tf]\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkeycar and use \ntensorflow-gpu\n dependency:\n\n\npip install donkeycar[tf_gpu]\n\n\n\n\nSee \nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7166\n for more information.",

This, however, requires you to adapt your training script (and model) to work in a distributed manner, preferably using the  SageMaker Python SDK , which is not currently available in Donkey.  That said, it is still possible to install and train your model on the  Notebook instance . It will allow you to train your  Keras model  using a beefy instance type with a large GPU, and, perhaps most importantly, shut it down when finished so that you only pay for what you use.",

Repeat this measurement for different steering values for turning each\ndirection.  Chart these so you can see if your car turns the same in each direction.   Corrections  If your car turns the same amount at an 80% turn and a 100% turn, change the\nPWM setting for that turn direction to be the PWM value at 80%.  If your car is biased to turn one direction, change the PWM values of your turns\nin the opposite direction of the bias.  After you've fine tuned your car the steering chart should look something like\nthis.",

This simulator is built on the the Unity game platform, uses their internal physics and graphics, and connects to a donkey Python process to use our trained model to control the simulated Donkey.\n\n\nDownload the Simulator\n\n\nYou will need a specific build per platform:\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 16.04 \ndownload\n\n\nMac 10.10.5+ \ndownload\n\n\nWindows 7+ \ndownload\n\n\n\n\nExtract this compressed file. It will create a folder containing an executable. Double click that executable to launch the simulator.\n\n\nExtra Mac Steps\n\n\nIf logs are not being generated you are probably running a version of OS X that sandboxes untrusted applications. This prevents the simulator writing to disk. To resolve this, move the executable within the Applications folder.\n\n\nRecorded Data\n\n\nThis simulator can create log data in the donkey tub format. This is stored in the \nlog\n dir at the root of the folder next to the executable. On the mac you will need to browse the package contents to see this folder. If this folder is missing, no data will be recorded.\n\n\nYou can choose two different scenes.\n\n\nGenerated Road Scene\n\n\nThe purpose of this is to create a randomly generated road so that you can have miles of curves on different road surfaces. You can train on one road and test on something similar, or a totally different surface.\n\n\nWarehouse Scene\n\n\nThe purpose of this is to create a specific track that is somewhat similar to an actual course in use as the primary track for the Oakland DIYRobocars Meetup.\n\n\n\n\nMenu Options:\n\n\nJoystick/Keyboard No Rec\n\n\nDrive the donkey with a joystick or keyboard. I used a PS2 Joystick and a PS3 Joystick. Keyboard controls use arrow keys to steer. In this mode, no data is recorded.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Keyboard data produces steering information that is stepped (ie. -1, 0, +1) and may be difficult to train with. See below for joystick setup.\n\n\n\n\nJoystick/Keyboard w Rec\n\n\nDrive the donkey with a joystick or keyboard. In this mode, data is stored in the tub donkey format.\n\n\nAuto Drive No Rec\n\n\nThis uses path information to guide the donkey down the track. It uses a PID controller to steer, so there is some oscillation. In this mode, no data is stored.\n\n\nAuto Drive w Rec\n\n\nThis uses path information to guide the donkey down the track. It uses a PID controller to steer, so there is some oscillation. In this mode, data is stored in the tub donkey format.\n\n\nNext Track\n\n\nIn the generated road scene, this will switch out the road surface and track width.\n\n\nRegen Track\n\n\nUse the current surface type, but generate a new random path and road.\n\n\n\n\nPID Controls\n\n\nMax Speed\n\n\nThis setting determines the target speed during the PID auto drive. It will also affect the speed when driving by keyboard controls (not recommended).\n\n\nProp\n\n\nThis is short for proportional. This is the P part of PID that attempts to adjust steering back to the path in proportion to the deviation.\n\n\nDiff\n\n\nThis is the D part of PID that attempts to limit steering back to the path as derivative to the trend of deviation, designed to limit overshoot.\n\n\nMax Steering\n\n\n\n\nNote - Max Steering is an important adjustment. This affects categorical training quite strongly. As the steering data is normalized when written, and multiplies after coming from Python, this angle should remain constant over training and simulation. Take care when changing this value. And separate data and models by max steering setting.\n\n\n\n\nMax steering can only be adjusted when using \nAuto Drive No Rec\n. It will also affect joystick and keyboard steering range, and should be saved and reloaded for you.\n\n\nThe default categorical model has 16 bins, or classes. And so, with a max steering of +-16, each bin will represent 2 degrees. It is helpful to graph the model training vs the example data to get and intuition about how it fits the data.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Use\n\n\n\n\nStart simulator\n\n\nDouble check that \nlog\n dir exists and is empty\n\n\nStart scene of your choice\n\n\nHit \nAuto Drive w Rec\n button\n\n\nVary the Max Speed, Prop, and Diff sliders to obtain a variety of driving styles\n\n\nWait 10-15 minutes until you have recorded 10K+ frames of data.\n\n\nHit the \nStop\n button\n\n\nHit the \nExit\n button\n\n\nMove the \nlog\n dir to the \n~/mycar/data/\n dir where you normally put tub data. This will create a \n~/mycar/data/log\n path.\n\n\nTrain as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I had problems w default categorical model. Linear model worked better for me.\n\n\n\n\npython manage.py train --tub=data/log --model=models/mypilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the simulator server.\n\n\n\n\ndonkey sim --model=models/mypilot\n\n\n\n\nWait to see \nwsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:9090\n\n\n\n\nEnter the scene of your choice in the simulator\n\n\nHit the button \nNN Steering w Websockets\n\n\nYour donkey should begin to move. You should see in the upper left two values for incoming steering and throttle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoystick Setup\n\n\nKeyboard input provides a poor learning signal. I recommend using the joystick to provide manual driving data.\n\n\nLinux Joystick Setup\n\n\nUnity on Linux uses the SDL library to see your joystick. And in particular the GamePad API. This is not setup by default. I needed to do these steps:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Grumbel/sdl-jstest\n\nsudo apt-get install cmake\nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev\nsudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev\ncd sdl-jstest\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake install\n\n\n./sdl2-jstest -l\n\n\n\n\nLook for:\nJoystick GUID: 030000004f04000008b1000000010000\n\n\nThe GUID will be different depending on your device.\n\n\nThen open:\nhttps://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt\n\n\nand look for your GUID in Linux section. One line is for one device type. Now modify your environment to specify information for your device:\n\n\nsudo -H gedit /etc/environment\n\n\n\n\nadd the line SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG=, make sure to add the quotes at begin and end. ie.\n\n\nSDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG=\"030000004f04000008b1000000010000, ... and the rest of the long line copied from gamecontrollerdb\"\n\n\n\n\nreboot\n\n\nstart sim\n\n\nchoose drive w joystick\n\n\nmove sticks\n\n\ndo happy dance",

            "text": "Roll Your Own Car\n\n\n\n\nThe Quick and Dirty\n\n\n\n\nYour car needs to be easy to control from a Raspberry Pi\n\n\nYour car needs to be not too large, because it will be too heavy and dangerous (and expensive)\n\n\nYour car needs to be not too small, because it needs to carry a certain minimum amount of equipment\n\n\nYour car needs to meet minimum performance standards in power and control for the model to make sense for it\n\n\nYour car needs to be smooth to control even at low speeds\n\n\n\n\nThis generally means:\n\n\n\n\nYour car needs to have a speed controller for the motor (ESC) that takes a standard RC 3-pin control signal (RC PWM style)\n\n\nYour car needs to have a steering servo that takes a standard RC 3-pin control signal (RC PWM style)\n\n\nYour car needs to have a radio receiver that contains standard 100-mil (2.54 mm) pin headers for each of the ESC and the steering servo.\n\n\nYour car needs to be between 1/18th scale (smallest end) and 1/8th scale (largest end) if you want to race in the DIYRobocars race.\n\n\nYour car needs to either use a brushed motor, or a sensored brushless motor. Sensorless brushless motors are too rough at low speeds.  If you buy a car with a brushless motor included it is invariably a sensorless brushless motor and will need to be replaced along with the ESC.\n\n\n\n\nOther options are perhaps possible, see the end of this document.\n\n\nMany car builders end up looking at \"integrated\" RC hobby cars, because they\nare typically cheaper. However, the reason these are cheaper, is that they will\nintegrate many parts of electronics and mechanics into a single package, which\nmeans that we can't intersect the appropriate signals to control the car with a\nRaspberry Pi. In fact, the expected signals may not even exist at all in an\nintegrated car.\n\n\nHere is an example of an integrated RX and ESC - typically these should be avoided:\n\n\n\nYou also need to know some things about electronics, such as the difference\nbetween power rails and control signals, what the duration of a microsecond is,\nand how Volts, Amperes, Watts, Hours, Ohms, and other measurement units relate.\n\n\nServo Specifics\n\n\nAn RC servo is used for controlling the steering wheels of the car. This servo\ntypically expects around 4.8V to 6V input on the power wire (varies by car) and\na PWM control signal on the signal wire. Typically, the three wires are colored\nblack-red-white, or brown-red-yellow, where the dark wire (black/brown) is ground,\nand the center wire (red) is power, and the light wire (white/yellow) is control.\n\n\nThe control signal is RC-style PWM, where one pulse is sent 60 times a second,\nand the width of this pulse controls how left/right the servo turns. When this\npulse is 1500 microseconds, the servo is centered; when the pulse is 1000\nmicroseconds, the servo is turned all the way left (or right) and when the pulse\nis 2000 microseconds, the servo is turned all the way in the other direction.\nThis is NOT the same kind of PWM that you would use to control the duty cycle of\na motor, or the brightness of a LED.\n\n\nThe power for the servo typically comes from the motor ESC, which has a BEC\n(Battery Eliminator Circuit) built in.\n\n\nESC Specifics\n\n\nThe role of the ESC is to take a RC PWM control signal (pulse between 1000 and\n2000 microseconds) in, and use that to control the power to the motor so the\nmotor spins with different amounts of power in forward or reverse. Again, 1500\nmicroseconds typically means \"center\" which for the motor means \"dead stop.\"\n\n\nThe battery typically connects straight to the ESC using thicker wiring than the\nsimple control signals, because the motor draws many more amps than the control.\nThe ESC then connects on to the motor with equally thick power wiring. The\nstandard Donkey motor and ESC probably have a peak current of about 12A; a\n1/8th scale RC car with powerful brushless motor can have a peak draw up to\n200A!\n\n\nAdditionally, the ESC typically contains a linear or switching voltage converter\nthat outputs the power needed to control the steering servo; this is typically\nsomewhere in the 4.8V to 6V range. Most BECs built into ESCs will not deliver\nmore than about 1A of current, so it is not typically possible to power both the\nsteering servo and the Raspberry Pi from the BEC.\n\n\nReceiver Specifics\n\n\nIf you buy a \"kit car\" that is listed as \"needs a receiver,\" then you don't need\nto buy a receiver. The Raspberry Pi plus the PCA9685 board take the role of the\nreceiver, outputting control signals to the car. Buying a \"kit car\" that comes\nwith steering servo, motor, and ESC, but not with radio, is actually a great way\nto make sure that the car you build will have the right signalling, because any\nRC car with separate receiver will be designed for the appropriate PWM signals.\n\n\nIf your car comes with a receiver, make sure it has the appropriate three-pin\nheaders next to each other for steering servo and for ESC control. Some receivers\nmay have additional three-pin headers for additional channels, which may be empty\nor may control fancy attachments like horns, lights, and so forth.\n\n\nThere is a modification to the Donkey car which uses the RC radio to drive the\ncar when collecting training data; this will give better control of the car than\nyou typically get with a PlayStation controller, or cell phone. However, it also\nrequires replacing the PCA9685 board with an external microcontroller, and\nchanging the software of the Donkey to use it.\n\n\nFinally, some receivers can output, in addition to the PWM control signals, a\nserial data packet that contains the control signals. An example of such a receiver\nis the FS-i6B, which has 6 output channels for PWM signals, but can output 10\nchannels of data at 115,200 bps as serial data, which you can read with an external\nmicrocontroller, or perhaps even with the Raspberry Pi (requries re-configuration\nof the Pi boot loader, and custom modifications to the donkey software.)\n\n\nBatteries\n\n\nThe Donkey comes with a Nickel Metal Hydride battery (NiMH) which is just enough\nto make its motor go, for a little bit of time (5-10 minutes) before needing a\nrecharge. The specifications on this battery are 6 cells, 1100 mAh. Because\nNiHM batteries range from 0.9V to 1.35V with a \"nominal\" voltage of 1.2V, you can\nexpect to see voltages in the 5.4V to 8.1V range.\n\n\nNiHM batteries have medium energy capacity per weight and volume. Thus, you can\nimprove the runtime and performance of the Magnet car by upgrading to a Lithium\nPolymer battery (LiPo.) Typically, you will get a 2 cell battery (2S) and\nLithium batteries have 3.2V to 4.2V per cell, so you will see voltages in the\n6.4V to 8.4V range. Additionally, Lithium Polymer batteries generally have higher\ncurrent capacity (amount of Amps the battery can deliver at one point while\ndriving) as well as energy storage (number of Amp Hours the battery stores when\nfully charged) so it may also last longer.\n\n\nNote that the amount of charge a battery can hold (how long it runs) is measured\nin Ampere-hours, or milli-Ampere-hours, whereas the amount of current a battery\ncan instantaneously deliver while driving is measured simply in Amperes. But to\nmake things more confusing, Amperes are often re-calculated in terms of multiples\nof the energy content, divided by one hour; this ratio is often called \"C.\" Thus,\na LiPo rated for 10C and 2000 mAh, can deliver 20 Amperes of current while\ndriving. A NiHM rated for 5C and 1100 mAh can deliver 5.5 Amperes of current while\ndriving. Batteries typically will deliver more than the C rating for very short\namounts of time, but will heat up or build up internal resistance such that that\nis not something you can rely on for normal operation.\n\n\nFor your custom car, be aware of the voltages needed for the ESC and motor of the\ncar, and make sure to get a battery that matches in voltage. Smaller RC cars will\ncome with NiMH for affordability, or 2S LiPo for power. Larger RC cars will use 3S\n(11.1V) or 4S (14.8V) or even 6S (22.2V) Lithium batteries, and thus need to have\nESC and motor combinations to match.\n\n\nFinally, be sure to get a charger that matches your battery. If you have a LiPo\nbattery, get a good Lithium battery charger, with a balancing plug that matches\nyour battery. Never discharge a Lithium battery below 3.2V per cell; if you let it\nrun dead, it will not want to be charged up to normal voltage again, and trying to\ndo so may very well overheat the batter and light it on fire! See YouTube pictures\nof burning Teslas for what that can look like. Seriously, houses have burned down\nbecause people have tried to save $10 by re-charging a Lithium battery that they\nforgot to disconnect and it ran down too much. It's not worth it. Instead, get a\nbattery alarm, that you plug into the battery balance connector, and it beeps when\nthe battery has discharged so much that you should disconnect and recharge it.\n\n\nPhysical Constraints\n\n\nAdding the additional battery and electronics for self-driving to a toy car will\nadd more load than the car was initially designed for. For a large, 1/8th scale\ncar, this may not be much of a problem. For a small car, 1/18th scale or below, the\nadditional weight and top-heaviness will cause the car to not react well to the\nsteering output, which may cause the self-driving model to be less able to control\nthe car.\n\n\nIf you use a car that's not the standard Magnet, at a minimum, you will have to\nfigure out how to mount all the hardware securely. Just piling things on and hoping\nwiring will keep it in place will not work for things that actually drive and turn.\nFinding good mounting points, and making your own \"base plate\" with measurements\nfrom the car you have, is likely to be necessary. You can build this base plate\nusing 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC milling, or even just drilling into a thin\npiece of plywood, but getting a good fit to your chassis is important, so don't\nrush it or try to cut corners.\n\n\nDoug LaRue also built a \nconfigurator\n in Thingiverse that enables people to easily make custom 3d printed plates.\n\n\nOther Options\n\n\nYes, you can make a self-driving car out of your 1/5th scale Nitro Dragster. You\nwill just have to learn even more about the different bits and pieces of the\nsolution, and figure out all the necessary integration yourself. The control\nsignals for a Nitro car are the same, so this might not even be hard. However, the\nindoors arenas used for Donkey Racing Meetups do not allow fuel-burning cars, only\nelectric.\n\n\nYes, you can make a self-driving car out of a cheap two-wheel chassis that uses\na LM298 H-bridge with direct PWM control to \"tank steer\" two wheels. However, you\nwill have to adapt the Donkey software to output the right steering controls, and\nyou will additionally have to figure out how to wire up the H-bridge to the Pi in\na way that makes sense to you; the PWM signals output by the PCA9685 board are the\nRC control kind, NOT the motor control kind! Also, most affordable two-wheel-drive\nrobot chassis are not actually big enough, strong enough, and mechanically\nconsistent enough to make for good Donkey Car candidates.",

However, the reason these are cheaper, is that they will\nintegrate many parts of electronics and mechanics into a single package, which\nmeans that we can't intersect the appropriate signals to control the car with a\nRaspberry Pi. In fact, the expected signals may not even exist at all in an\nintegrated car.  Here is an example of an integrated RX and ESC - typically these should be avoided:  You also need to know some things about electronics, such as the difference\nbetween power rails and control signals, what the duration of a microsecond is,\nand how Volts, Amperes, Watts, Hours, Ohms, and other measurement units relate.",

            "text": "An RC servo is used for controlling the steering wheels of the car. This servo\ntypically expects around 4.8V to 6V input on the power wire (varies by car) and\na PWM control signal on the signal wire. Typically, the three wires are colored\nblack-red-white, or brown-red-yellow, where the dark wire (black/brown) is ground,\nand the center wire (red) is power, and the light wire (white/yellow) is control.  The control signal is RC-style PWM, where one pulse is sent 60 times a second,\nand the width of this pulse controls how left/right the servo turns. When this\npulse is 1500 microseconds, the servo is centered; when the pulse is 1000\nmicroseconds, the servo is turned all the way left (or right) and when the pulse\nis 2000 microseconds, the servo is turned all the way in the other direction.\nThis is NOT the same kind of PWM that you would use to control the duty cycle of\na motor, or the brightness of a LED.  The power for the servo typically comes from the motor ESC, which has a BEC\n(Battery Eliminator Circuit) built in.",

            "text": "The role of the ESC is to take a RC PWM control signal (pulse between 1000 and\n2000 microseconds) in, and use that to control the power to the motor so the\nmotor spins with different amounts of power in forward or reverse. Again, 1500\nmicroseconds typically means \"center\" which for the motor means \"dead stop.\"  The battery typically connects straight to the ESC using thicker wiring than the\nsimple control signals, because the motor draws many more amps than the control.\nThe ESC then connects on to the motor with equally thick power wiring. The\nstandard Donkey motor and ESC probably have a peak current of about 12A; a\n1/8th scale RC car with powerful brushless motor can have a peak draw up to\n200A!  Additionally, the ESC typically contains a linear or switching voltage converter\nthat outputs the power needed to control the steering servo; this is typically\nsomewhere in the 4.8V to 6V range. Most BECs built into ESCs will not deliver\nmore than about 1A of current, so it is not typically possible to power both the\nsteering servo and the Raspberry Pi from the BEC.",

The Raspberry Pi plus the PCA9685 board take the role of the\nreceiver, outputting control signals to the car. Buying a \"kit car\" that comes\nwith steering servo, motor, and ESC, but not with radio, is actually a great way\nto make sure that the car you build will have the right signalling, because any\nRC car with separate receiver will be designed for the appropriate PWM signals.  If your car comes with a receiver, make sure it has the appropriate three-pin\nheaders next to each other for steering servo and for ESC control. Some receivers\nmay have additional three-pin headers for additional channels, which may be empty\nor may control fancy attachments like horns, lights, and so forth.  There is a modification to the Donkey car which uses the RC radio to drive the\ncar when collecting training data; this will give better control of the car than\nyou typically get with a PlayStation controller, or cell phone. However, it also\nrequires replacing the PCA9685 board with an external microcontroller, and\nchanging the software of the Donkey to use it.  Finally, some receivers can output, in addition to the PWM control signals, a\nserial data packet that contains the control signals. An example of such a receiver\nis the FS-i6B, which has 6 output channels for PWM signals, but can output 10\nchannels of data at 115,200 bps as serial data, which you can read with an external\nmicrocontroller, or perhaps even with the Raspberry Pi (requries re-configuration\nof the Pi boot loader, and custom modifications to the donkey software.)",

            "text": "The Donkey comes with a Nickel Metal Hydride battery (NiMH) which is just enough\nto make its motor go, for a little bit of time (5-10 minutes) before needing a\nrecharge. The specifications on this battery are 6 cells, 1100 mAh. Because\nNiHM batteries range from 0.9V to 1.35V with a \"nominal\" voltage of 1.2V, you can\nexpect to see voltages in the 5.4V to 8.1V range.  NiHM batteries have medium energy capacity per weight and volume. Thus, you can\nimprove the runtime and performance of the Magnet car by upgrading to a Lithium\nPolymer battery (LiPo.) Typically, you will get a 2 cell battery (2S) and\nLithium batteries have 3.2V to 4.2V per cell, so you will see voltages in the\n6.4V to 8.4V range. Additionally, Lithium Polymer batteries generally have higher\ncurrent capacity (amount of Amps the battery can deliver at one point while\ndriving) as well as energy storage (number of Amp Hours the battery stores when\nfully charged) so it may also last longer.  Note that the amount of charge a battery can hold (how long it runs) is measured\nin Ampere-hours, or milli-Ampere-hours, whereas the amount of current a battery\ncan instantaneously deliver while driving is measured simply in Amperes. But to\nmake things more confusing, Amperes are often re-calculated in terms of multiples\nof the energy content, divided by one hour; this ratio is often called \"C.\" Thus,\na LiPo rated for 10C and 2000 mAh, can deliver 20 Amperes of current while\ndriving. A NiHM rated for 5C and 1100 mAh can deliver 5.5 Amperes of current while\ndriving. Batteries typically will deliver more than the C rating for very short\namounts of time, but will heat up or build up internal resistance such that that\nis not something you can rely on for normal operation.  For your custom car, be aware of the voltages needed for the ESC and motor of the\ncar, and make sure to get a battery that matches in voltage. Smaller RC cars will\ncome with NiMH for affordability, or 2S LiPo for power. Larger RC cars will use 3S\n(11.1V) or 4S (14.8V) or even 6S (22.2V) Lithium batteries, and thus need to have\nESC and motor combinations to match.  Finally, be sure to get a charger that matches your battery. If you have a LiPo\nbattery, get a good Lithium battery charger, with a balancing plug that matches\nyour battery. Never discharge a Lithium battery below 3.2V per cell; if you let it\nrun dead, it will not want to be charged up to normal voltage again, and trying to\ndo so may very well overheat the batter and light it on fire! See YouTube pictures\nof burning Teslas for what that can look like. Seriously, houses have burned down\nbecause people have tried to save $10 by re-charging a Lithium battery that they\nforgot to disconnect and it ran down too much. It's not worth it. Instead, get a\nbattery alarm, that you plug into the battery balance connector, and it beeps when\nthe battery has discharged so much that you should disconnect and recharge it.",
